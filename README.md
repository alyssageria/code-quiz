# Code Quiz Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create functional quiz from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Building this quiz from scratch, it gave me a lot of clarity on how to make all languages correlate with one another. 

## Usage

You can navigate through this quiz with the buttons that are displayed on screen. The quiz is timed and begins once the start button is clicked, answer the questions the the best of your ability and the following question will be displayed as any of the answer buttons are clicked. Any questions answered wrong will deduct time from your score, and your total at the end will be the remaining time left. There is a form for you to input your initials and submit it to the highscores page. If you would like to see your highscores there is a button called "view highscores" that will display the highscore page.
